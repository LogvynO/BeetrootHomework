            Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
            looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to their
            own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the
            documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

          <p>
            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
            capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable
            code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
            let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.
          </p>
          <div class="blackborder"></div>
          <h2 id="React">React Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>
            React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for
            building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React
            Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get
            you started or can serve as a refresher course. We‚Äôre going to cover
            the core concepts behind React:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this
            introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
            approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a
            syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
            <span class="highlight"
              >&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span
            >. The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to
            learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables
            inside it. Here you are declaring a
            <span class="highlight">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding
            it with curly braces inside
            <span class="highlight">&lt;Text&gt;</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as
            arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like
            a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling
            data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
            State gives your components memory!
          </p>
          <div class="blackborder"></div>
          <h2 id="Handling">Handling Text Input</h2>
          <p>
            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
            has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every
            time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
            function to be called when the text is submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
            there Bob" would be translated as "üçïüçïüçï".
